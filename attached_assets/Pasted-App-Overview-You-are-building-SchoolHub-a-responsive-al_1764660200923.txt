App Overview:
You are building SchoolHub, a responsive (all-device) school management/monitoring app for education field teams. The system serves a strict user hierarchy: DEO, DDEO, AEO, Head Teachers, and Teachers, each with a role-based interface and access.

For this prototype, focus on:

Login flow: User logs in using their phone number, chooses role, enters password. The system must route every user to a unique dashboard and menu based on their role.
“Data Requests” workflow:
Users at higher levels (DEO, DDEO, AEO, Head Teacher) can create, assign, track, and audit data requests down to any user below them in the hierarchy.
Data requests allow any combination of fields: text, number, file/photo, and voice note attachment.
Requests can be assigned as “bulk” (to a group) or to an individual.
Lower-level users (e.g., Teachers) can only see and edit their assigned row; everything else is locked down/read-only.
Voice note playback works in UI, even if real uploads aren’t implemented in prototyping.
Permission logic:
DEO/DDEO: Full data access, can create/track/see all requests and responses.
AEO: Can create and assign within their cluster/schools, view only what’s under their scope.
Head Teacher: Issue requests to teachers, respond to higher-ups, see/respond for their school only.
Teacher: Respond to assigned data line(s)/requests only; no access to peer/other school data.
UI Priorities:
“Data Requests” is a top-level nav item.
Request list shows: requester, assignees, due date, status (completed/pending/overdue), and direct “export CSV” for supervisors.
On assignment, user lands directly on their task (row), with clear field types—including voice note.
Audit/assignee trail shown in details pane.
For your prototype:

Mock all flows in frontend-only React—no live backend needed, but do show different dashboards/permissions by logged-in role.
Use simple, professional design with strong clarity around actions and access (“Edit” disabled for unassigned users, voice note player for audio).
Priority user for the prototype: AEO and Teacher (show how AEO creates and assigns request; Teacher receives, fills, and submits their row, locked out from others).
Add DEO and Head Teacher dashboards as stubs showing their full visibility (list of all requests, exports).
Summary for sltech:
Prototype the login (with role), then the full create-assign-complete-export data request flow between AEO and Teachers, with front-end logic enforcing all access controls. Voice note fields must be clearly visible/usable. DEO/DDEO/HT can see everything; Teachers can only edit their task. “Data Requests” should be a primary, always-available hub in the UI.
