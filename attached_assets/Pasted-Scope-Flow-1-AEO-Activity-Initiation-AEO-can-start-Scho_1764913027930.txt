Tehsil, Markaz, AEO Name, School Name, Date, Arrival/Departure Time
Teacher Presence: Total, Present, Percentage
Head Teacher Presence: Yes/No/On duty/Leave/Other
Student Attendance: Total, Present, Percentage

Mentoring Visit (HOTS) Form:
Use higher-order skills matrix/rubric, capturing ratings for each indicator with supporting text and examples.
Mentoring Visit (HOTS) Indicators & Rubrics:

Classroom Environment:
Discussions & critical thinking (teacher-dominated → student-led, collaborative problem-solving)
Resources for collaboration/problem-solving (none → well-organized)
Students encouraged for complex tasks
Lesson Planning:
Objectives linked to thinking/problem-solving
Plan includes analysis, evaluation, synthesis
Integration of real-world/interdisciplinary
Instructional Strategies:
Open-ended, thought-provoking questions
Student analysis, critique, interpretation
Demonstrates problem-solving/creativity
Scaffolding higher-order tasks (levels of guidance)
Student Engagement:
Individual/collaborative problem-solving
Multiple perspectives, novel solutions
Assessment & Feedback:
Self-/peer-assessment (consistency/purpose)
Specific, actionable feedback
Assignments involving higher-order tasks (analysis, creation)
Each scored as Emerging/Developing/Proficient with rubric examples provided (see extracts above).

Office Visit:
Simple form with:
Arrival/Departure time
Purpose/short summary (dropdown or text)
Core office activities completed (checklist—admin, reporting, coordination, etc.)
3. Other Activities for AEOs:

When not planning a visit, AEO can select from a dropdown/list of department-approved activities:
Attending training
Conducting community mobilization
Participating in departmental meetings
Report/data compilation
Hotline/complaint resolution
Supervision of office/admin tasks
(See uploaded “Other AEO activities” doc for full text.)
Each activity should allow description/comments and timestamp.

4. Features & UI/UX:

All forms are dynamic, mandatory fields enforced, auto-save offline, and easy attachment of evidence/voice notes.
Each activity/visit/other log is fully auditable, tagged by user/time.
Only authorized users can create, edit, or see relevant tasks.
Rubrics for mentoring must present indicator, rating levels (with color/tooltip), and rubric example text side-by-side.
Clear success/completion feedback after each submission.
Summary for sltech:
Build three main visit forms (Monitoring, Mentoring, Office) each matched exactly to the department’s indicators/rubrics plus a fourth option for “Other Activities.” Monitoring and mentoring forms must present the correct field/rating layout, examples, and handle evidence. “Other Activities” are a separate, auditable log based on the provided official list.

If you want checklist or JSON for indicators, or sample field layout/wireframe, ask!

Here is a clear, comprehensive prompt for Replit/sltech that provides (a) your visit indicator forms for Monitoring, Mentoring, and Office, (b) detailed extracted indicators and rubrics, and (c) how AEOs can select from an official “Other Activities” list when not planning a visit.

Any logged or planned task is matched to work calendar and performance dashboard.
Summary for Developer:
Support structured, policy-matching Monitoring, Mentoring, and Office visit forms–with extracted indicator fields and rubric-scale scoring where required. Always provide the option for “Other Activities” when not on a visit, tied to a centrally managed, updatable activity list. All forms/audit logs must be exportable, evidence-supported, and presented in a modern, clear UI.
