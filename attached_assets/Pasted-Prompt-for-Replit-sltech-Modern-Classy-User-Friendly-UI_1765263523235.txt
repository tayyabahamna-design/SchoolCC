Prompt for Replit/sltech: Modern, Classy, User-Friendly UI (Beige & Black Theme)

Objective:
Deliver a contemporary, visually pleasing, and intuitive UI for SchoolHub. The design must use a beige background and bold black for high contrast and modern luxury—applicable to every user, from CEO to teacher.

UI/UX and Visual Directions
Color Theme:

Use a welcoming beige (e.g., #FFF6E5, #F8ECD1, or similar) for the main background.
All primary text, icons, and actions should be deep, rich black (#111111).
Primary/CTA buttons: black or elegant dark-brown fill with white/beige text; use gold or bronze for highlights and hover states if desired.
Cards and data blocks: slightly lighter shades of beige or off-white, with warm floating shadows.
Typography:

Modern, readable sans-serif (Inter, Segoe UI, DM Sans) for clarity.
Bold, large area/section headings; generous line-height and spacing for all body text.
Cards, Shadow, and Depth:

All cards should float prominently using smooth shadows, substantial padding, and rounded corners for an inviting feel.
Buttons/Interactions:

Primary actions: large, black or deep brown, rounded, with smooth hover.
Secondary/outlined actions: muted beige fill, crisp black border, change state on hover.
Animations on hover/click should make interactive elements feel “alive.”
Navigation/Layout:

Sidebar: vertical, beige, with bold black icons and text. The current section is subtly highlighted using gold, bronze, or a richer beige tone.
All icons left-aligned with text, uniform in size and style.
Dashboard: prioritize major CTAs (“Plan a Visit,” “Create Data Request”) at the top; activity cards and analytics below.
Activity and Analytics Cards:

Use black/gold icons minimally for accents within activity cards.
All metrics, stats, and activity counters as elevated, clickable cards.
Clear badge/status (using gold/bronze) for due, overdue, or completed activity.
Responsiveness & Accessibility:

Ensure all text is fully legible (high contrast) against beige.
Mobile layouts must preserve the inviting, open feel; stack and prioritize actions for touch.
Modals/Feedback:

All popups/modals with beige backgrounds, black text, clear close controls, and smooth drop shadows.
Feedback and toasts use subtle accent color (e.g., pale gold) with solid text readability.
Summary for dev/design:

Commit to beige for all backgrounds, deep black for text and CTAs, gold/bronze for accent.
Modern, generous spacing and shadow everywhere.
Placement, navigation, and UI flows must make the app as enjoyable to use as any leading modern SaaS.
No need to reference grey—just affirm what is wanted.
