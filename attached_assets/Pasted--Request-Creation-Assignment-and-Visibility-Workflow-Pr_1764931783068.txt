 Request Creation, Assignment, and Visibility Workflow

Product Rules:

Hierarchy for Creation & Assignment
Any user (CEO, DEO, DDEO, AEO, Head Teacher) can create a request and assign it ONLY to people below them in the org chart.
At every point, the UI for “Assign To” MUST only show valid direct subordinates—not peers or users above.
Visibility
Requests can be viewed by:
The creator (always)
The current assignee(s) (always)
Anyone higher up in the hierarchy, recursively. Example:
CEO sees everything below (all requests).
DEO sees all requests assigned to/by any DDEO, AEO, Head Teacher, or Teacher in their district.
Head Teacher sees only requests they created, assigned to them, or involving their own teachers (not other schools).
Teachers see only requests assigned to them or they themselves created.
No other users can see the request.
Concrete Example UI/Logic:
If a Head Teacher is logged in, when assigning, only Teachers at their school are selectable.
If a DEO is logged in, they can assign to any DDEO/AEO below, and view all requests in their district.
A Teacher cannot create requests upwards, only to their Head Teacher (if that’s permitted by policy).
Requests Page Filtering:
When any user views the requests dashboard:
Show all requests they created
Show all requests assigned to them
Show all requests created/assigned by or to anyone below in their jurisdiction tree
Audit and Review:
Every request should store creator, assignee(s), and school/cluster. The audit log should record creation, viewing, and reassignment with timestamps and user roles.
No Cross/Upward Assignment:
Prevent creation or assignment of requests to peers or to users higher in the org.
Summary for developers:

Enforce strict “assign down” only, never sideways or up.
Ensure all request filtering and visibility follows the org chart, with upward visibility (superiors see all below; never the reverse).
Check all dashboards/lists respect these permissions.
If you want role/request-assignment matrix or sample JSON, just let dl know.
Acceptance test:
A Head Teacher, DEO, and Teacher should each see only the requests they’re entitled to, with absolutely no “peeking” across schools, upwards, or outside their jurisdiction.
