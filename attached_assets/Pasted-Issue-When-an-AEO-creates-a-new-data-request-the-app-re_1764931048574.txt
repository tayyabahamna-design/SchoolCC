Issue:
When an AEO creates a new data request, the app redirects to the Data Requests page, but the new request does not appear in the request list/dashboard—even though it should show up immediately.

Diagnostic/Action Points:

Ensure that after creating a request, the request is actually being written to localStorage under the right key (usually "dataRequests" or similar).
Confirm that each new request includes the correct createdBy field set to the currently logged-in user's ID.
On the Data Requests page, check that the getRequestsForUser function or equivalent is:
Pulling the latest version of requests from localStorage (no stale cache/state),
Filtering using the exact user ID you use when saving (createdBy === userID), and
NOT filtering with a mismatched key, undefined userID, or subtle casing issues (createdby vs createdBy).
Add a debugging console log so when a request is created and/or listed, you can inspect localStorage and the current userID.
What to check or change:

After creating a request, open DevTools and log:
js


console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('dataRequests')));
and
js


console.log("Current userID", userID);
If requests do not have the correct createdBy, or if nothing appears in localStorage, there is a bug in the save logic.
If localStorage has the new request but the UI does not show it, the filter is wrong or not re-triggering.
Expected behavior:

Once a request is created and you are redirected to the Data Requests page, you should see your request in the list/table instantly, reflecting any changes in localStorage and matching against your userID.
Please:

Check for silent failures in saving or filtering.
Ensure localStorage is actually persistent (not cleared on reload/refresh).
After fixing, test by creating a new request and verifying it is shown immediately on the requests page without page reload.
If needed, paste the request creation, storage, and filtering code here for further review.

This is the standard web app data state bug—check save, check filter, check refresh. Fixing this will unblock the most critical workflow.

Here is an explicit prompt to give to Replit/dev to debug and fix the requests dashboard issue:

Bug Report / Prompt: Data Requests Not Visible After Creation

Problem:
When I (AEO) create a data request, the request saves (to localStorage) and the app navigates to the Data Requests page, but the request does NOT appear in the request list/dashboard—despite the recent changes (“useEffect”, userID filter, etc.).

What to check and fix:

Check save: Is the new request actually being added to the localStorage array? Add a console.log right after save to verify the request object and array.
Consistent keys: Ensure the createdBy field in each saved request exactly matches the userID (case and type). Check whether your filtering is using “createdBy”, “created_by”, etc.
Filter logic: In getRequestsForUser, log out both the userID and each request's createdBy to ensure the filter is matching as intended.
State updates: After saving the request, explicitly trigger re-reading the updated localStorage (not relying on a possibly stale state).
Key mismatch: Make sure the localStorage key (e.g., “dataRequests”) is consistent in both the save and load code.
How to debug:

Add a console.log of the entire requests array and the current userID on the requests dashboard load.
After request creation, manually reload the Data Requests page—if the request appears now, the issue is with your useEffect/state re-fetch logic.
Test with two users: ensure both see only their requests, not all.
Expected:
After I create a request, it should always immediately appear in my Data Requests page—with no page refresh or re-login required.
