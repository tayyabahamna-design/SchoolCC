Prompt for Replit — SchoolHub CEO Role & Multi-Level Hierarchy

System Scope:
SchoolHub is a modern, role-driven, cross-device platform for education system monitoring, analytics, and data requests. The hierarchy is deeply nested:

One CEO oversees multiple DEOs (District Education Officers).
Each DEO manages multiple DDEOs (Deputy DEOs).
Each DDEO (or DEO directly) manages multiple AEOs (Assistant Education Officers).
Each AEO covers multiple schools, each with its own Head Teacher(s) and multiple Teachers.
CEO Role & Access:

CEO has a dedicated login, with a dashboard aggregating and filtering analytics across ALL DEOs, DDEOs, and AEOs, clusters, schools, and staff below.
CEO views KPIs, compliance, overdue actions, visit/request trends, and can drill down from aggregate to district/cluster/school, or assign escalations/flags to any subordinate.
CEO does not edit field data or requests, but can download/export any data, audit any evidence, and see a full system audit trail.
The CEO dashboard should cleanly visualize:
Multiple DEO activity (table, map, or chart)
Drilled-down chain: select a DEO → see their DDEOs, then any DDEO → see their AEOs, etc., down to school and individual teacher/task level.
Ability to filter, subgroup, and summarize at any level.
Organization Awareness:

The software must incorporate that there can be:
Multiple DEOs under one CEO
Multiple DDEOs under each DEO
Multiple AEOs under each DDEO (or DEO direct)
Multiple schools under each AEO
Multiple Head Teachers/Teachers per school
All user/account management, dashboards, assignment, audit, and download flows must respect this tree structure.
UI/UX Notes:

Clean, modern interface; crisp white or gray backgrounds with deep blue/green action color.
CEO’s dashboard = “mission control”—live analytics, summary cards by region, powerful filters, all teams/requests/alerts in a few clicks.
Every card/chart/list must state clearly which district/DEO/AEO/school it represents and allow CEO to jump into details or export with one click.
Data Request & Evidence Flows:

Data requests and evidence review flow up and down the chain, always referencing which managers, AEOs, Head Teachers, teachers are involved.
CEO can see the complete request/response chain for any data point, in any school, under any subordinate officer.
For Prototype:

Demo full CEO login, show dashboard across multiple DEOs and their cascaded structures.
Illustrate drill-down and filter (CEO → DEO → DDEO → AEO → Headmaster → Teacher).
Maintain strict, role-based read vs. write access—CEO is read-only at all levels except escalations/flags.
Summary:
Build the app with flexibility: support any number of DEOs/DDEOs/AEOs/schools/headmasters/teachers under the CEO, and make it easy for the CEO to see what's happening anywhere, anytime, at any level.
