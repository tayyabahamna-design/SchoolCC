Prompt for Replit/sltech – Full UI/UX Modernization (Not just color!)

Visual Tone
Keep the beige and black palette, but the interface needs to feel modern—not just look differently colored.
Elevate all major cards and quick actions with stronger shadows, bigger border radii, and more vertical spacing between rows.
Component Redesign & Layout
Group quick actions into a visually distinct, slightly elevated card or section with more breathing room.
Quick actions should use bold, full-width primary/secondary buttons or large icon chips. Use a clear visual separation between navigation, analytics, and actions.
Make the “Your Activities” and “Recent Activity” areas have more spacing and a slightly lighter beige card background than the page for true depth.
Dashboard cards (stats, recent activity) should be more interactive—hover scales them, click allows drilldown.
Main CTAs (Plan a Visit, Create Data Request) should look “touchable”—stronger elevation, bold text, very clear active/hover states.
Navigation & Icon Placement
Place icons consistently to the left of button/card labels.
Sidebar (if present) should float with large icons and clear active indication; for header-nav, group sections with clear space between.
Remove crowded button clusters—group actions logically.
Profile/avatar and logout should be in the upper right, stylized as a modern button or dropdown, not a legacy pill.
Interactions
Transitions: All modals, toasts, and tooltips should use simple, smooth fade/slide effects (not instant pop-in).
Card and button hover uses elevation and background color animation (e.g., gold or subtle bronze glow on primary actions).
Typography
Increase base font size (minimum 16px for body, bigger for cards/analytics). Use more aggressive headings for section titles.
Make numbers, due-dates, and labels large and easy to scan.
Mobile Responsiveness
Card layout must stack cleanly into one column on mobile—never cause horizontal scroll.
Clarity
Remove all unnecessary borders, lines, and crowded clusters UI. Use whitespace as a design element.
Sample References
Use modern SaaS like Notion, Linear, Stripe, or Apple Notes web dashboard as visual references for floating cards/action clarity.
Summary for Devs:
A modern UI is not a color swap. This means more padding, real card elevation, bold readable fonts, smooth rounded corners, interactive cards/buttons, beautiful hover, best-in-class iconography, and smart layout grouping. It needs to be beautiful, clear, and relaxed—easy to scan, fun to touch, a joy to use.
